# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Details
This project aims to develop a **Movie Recommendation System** that leverages the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset to provide content-based recommendations. 

### Dataset
- **TMDB**: A rich dataset containing movie information, including titles, overviews, genres, and more.

### Recommendation Type
- **Content-based Recommendation**: This system will recommend movies based on item similarity using the content of the movies.
- **Other Types of Recommendations**:
  - Item-based
  - User-based
  - Collaborative Filtering

### Tech Stack to Use in Production
To build this system, we will utilize the following technologies:

- **Data Storage and Processing**:
  - **Snowflake** or **Kafka**: For managing and processing the TMDB dataset.

- **Search and Recommendation Engine**:
  - **VESPA** or **ElasticSearch**: For efficient indexing and searching of movie records.

- **Workflow Management**:
  - **Apache Airflow**: To orchestrate the data pipeline.
    - **DAG 1**: A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to read the latest TMDB data into Snowflake, creating a TMDB table.
    - **DAG 2**: A DAG to process the TMDB table records and push the processed data to VESPA for further recommendations.
